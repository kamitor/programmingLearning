# Kinds of programming languages
High level
C#, python, 
PHP, Ruby, R, javascript

Mid level
C, C++, Go

low level

Assembly languages 

Some languages are interpreted languages;

Then you have markup languages
HTML
CSS
Markdown
Latex

- Used for styling not the programming.

Some old languages:
These languages are in use because. 
Fortran
Pascal
Basic
Perl

Where are they used:
- Web, Front-end : 
Web, Back-end: PHP, Java, Javascript, Ruby, Python

Apps:
- Andriod: Java, C or C++
- iOS: Swift or Objective C
Data science: Python, R, Java, Juia, matlab.
Desktop software; C, C++ , C#, Java, Python.
Linux systems: C, C++, Python, Java, Bash.
ECMA-script (ES)
"Development with web-technologies": also used for apps, servers (back-end with node.JS) and desktop software (e.g with electron)
Lots of different frameworks: Angular, react, vue.js, node.js, Jquery. 

# Where do development languages come from?
ISO/ IEC standard: C, C++, Javascript.
Python sofware foundation: Python
PHP group: PHP
Mozilla; Rust

Oracle (sun) : Java
Microsoft: C#, Typescript, VB.Net, F#
Apple: Objective C, Swift
Google; Go, Kotlin.

# Is it fast to run functional programs?

Easy to diffecult: Ruby < Python < C < C++?
for speed, in tendency
    - Fast: C, C++
    - Medium: Python.
    - Slower: Java, Ruby
But speed depends a lot on how the code is written.

# Memory leaks
- not so secure : C , C ++ (because it does not do garbage collection)
- Rust was designed as a more secure alternative to C and C++

# Object orientated VS functional programming
"Some of the characeristics hat object-orientated programming languages end to share are objects["]"

Object orientation

- It's a programming paradigm
- It's like a recepy programming
- imperative programming. 

Functional Programming

- Mathematical approach
Functional programming languages E.G. haskell, Erland, F#
You can use the idea i other languages, too.
You don't give the program instructions, but you give the computer formulas.
